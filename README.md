# rtx
deterministic RTOS from Keil for ARM Cortex-M devices with code under a BSD-style license


This code is a mirror and line-ending cleanup of RTX version 4 from Keil.
It is a deterministic real time operating system which implements the CMSIS-RTOS API.
The code is under a BSD-style license.
This repository will reflect if and when there are any updates to RTX version 4,\
as RTX version 5 is not under a BSD-style license.

Keil has created RTX5 which implements the CMSIS-RTOS2 API.
It is under the Apache 2 license so it will not be mirrored here.
RTX5 is available from its own Github repository at
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5
